AUTOMATED TESTING
=================

TEST GROUP: Basic Implementation
|__ Command Sequence: NICK -> USER -> MODE -> QUIT


MANUAL TESTING & INSTRUCTOR OBSERVATIONS
========================================

- Automated testing hangs/prematurely ended/inconclusive.
	- unable to verify full command implementations
	- unable to verify reply code implementations
	- unable to vorify grammar confirmity and protocol specs
- No evidence of communication through channels. Channel updates not broadcast to members
- Can't verify PRIVMSG
	- Unable to verify basic IRC functionality (direct and through channel communication)
- In-memory data management (while functional in limited testing, will eventually fail when scaled up)
